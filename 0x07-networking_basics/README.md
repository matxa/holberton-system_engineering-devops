## Learning Objectives


### OSI Model - Open System Interconnection



*   What it is - Helps the user identify what is happening within a networking system.
*   It has 7 layers.

### What is a LAN - Local Area Network



*   Connects the computer hardware in a localized area such as an office or home. Typically, LANs **use** wired connections to link the computers to each other and to a variety of peripheral devices such as printers.
*   Typical geographical size - Local(house, buildings, campus)


### What is a WAN - Wide Area Network



*   A telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking.


### What is the Internet



*   What is an IP address - An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication
*   What are the 2 types of IP address - Public and Private
*   What is localhost - is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it.
*   What is a subnet - A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.
*   Why IPv6 was created - IPv6 was developed by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of [IPv4 address exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion). IPv6 is intended to replace


### TCP/UDP

Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol



*   What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema) - TCP/UDP
*   End-to-end connection
*   **What is the main difference between TCP and UDP** - TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and UDP is a connection-less protocol. TCP establishes a connection between a sender and receiver before data can be sent. UDP does not establish a connection before sending data.

    TCP - is more efficient but slower


    UDP - Faster but inefficient

*   **What is a port** - In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service
*   **Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers - **SSH(Port 22), HTTP(Port 80), HTTPS(Port 443)
*   What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
